# Component Name: ComponentBatchCreator

## Description

The ComponentBatchCreator is a Yeager component that takes a list of components in YAML format and generates their corresponding Python class files using the ComponentCreatorWorkflow.

## Input and Output Models

The input and output data types for the ComponentBatchCreator are as follows:

### Input Model: ComponentListYaml

- `component_list_yaml` (str): A YAML string containing a list of component objects, where each component object includes `name` and `description` keys.

### Output Model: GeneratedComponents

- `generated_components` (List[str]): A list containing the names of successfully generated component files.

## Parameters

The ComponentBatchCreator component has the following parameters:

- `component_configuration_path()` (str): Returns the path to the configuration file of the ComponentBatchCreator component.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the ComponentBatchCreator component works as follows:

1. Load the list of components to generate from the input YAML string.
2. Iterate through each component in the list.
3. Instantiate a `ComponentCreatorWorkflow` object.
4. Pass the component's `name` and `description` to the `transform()` method of the instantiated `ComponentCreatorWorkflow`.
5. Collect the names of the generated component files in a list.
6. Return an instance of the `GeneratedComponents` output model containing the list of generated components.

## External Dependencies

The ComponentBatchCreator component uses the following external libraries:

- `os`: For loading environment variables.
- `yaml`: For processing YAML data.
- `fastapi`: For creating the API endpoint for the `transform()` method.
- `pydantic`: For validation and serialization of the input and output models.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

## API Calls

The ComponentBatchCreator component does not make any external API calls.

## Error Handling

Any specific exceptions and error messages will be handled by the input and output models through the underlying Pydantic library, which takes care of data type validation.

If a YAML string cannot be parsed, an error in the underlying `safe_load()` function will be raised.
