# Yeager SDK

```
Hey there, AI enthusiasts!

We are thrilled to introduce you to Yeager SDK, the groundbreaking platform that harnesses the power of generative AI to design, code, test, and deploy software.

Our platform offers a wide range of features that streamline development and make it more accessible to everyone. With the limitless potential of generative AI, the possibilities for creating innovative software are truly endless. We want you to dive in and explore these possibilities and we encourage you to share your discoveries with the community.

We strongly believe that collaboration and shared knowledge are essential to push the boundaries of AI development, and we are excited to see what we can achieve together. Let's work together to build the apps that will shape the future of humanity!

Warmly,
The Yeager Team

## Getting Started

To get started with the Yeager SDK, follow these steps:

1. Install the Yeager SDK on your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install yeager-sdk
    ```

2. Start the Yeager server by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python start_server.py
    ```
   This will start the @yeager engine and open a socket for the client to connect to.

3. Start the Yeager command-line interface (CLI) by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python yeager_cli.py
    ```
   This will connect the CLI to the server and allow you to interact with @yeager in natural language.

4. Start building your app using Yeager-CLI! You can give natural language commands to @yeager through the CLI, and @yeager will build the workflows and projects for you.

## Features

- **Natural language input**: Yeager allows developers to describe their app idea in plain English, making it easy to get started a project started in seconds.

- **Automated code generation**: Yeager generates code, workflows, and documentation automatically, reducing the need for manual coding and saving time.

- **Total control**: Yeager's interactive modification cycle lets you fine-tune the generated code and workflows to meet your specific needs, providing total control over your app development process.


## Examples

Here are a few examples of how you could use the Yeager SDK in your own app development projects:

### Example 1: 

```
Create a workflow that when I receive a new lead on hubspot send a greeting email via Mailchimp with a banner created by midjourney
```

### Example 2: 
```
Create a workflow that receives a python repository and modifies the code to pass the pylint, mypy, and pytest tests
```
