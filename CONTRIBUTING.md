# Contributing to Yeager SDK

We welcome contributions of all kinds to Yeager SDK, whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or just an improvement to the documentation. By contributing to this project, you'll be joining a community of developers who are passionate about AI and Open Source.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes with a descriptive name, such as feature/new-feature or bugfix/fix-bug.
3. Make your changes and commit them to your branch.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Submit a pull request from your branch to the 'master' branch of the main repository.

By creating a separate branch for your changes, you can keep your work isolated from the main codebase and avoid conflicts with other contributors' changes. Additionally, it allows for easier review of your changes by the maintainers of the Yeager SDK project.
