# Component Creator

### **Component Nodes**

The CFC consists of several component nodes, each of which performs a specific task. Here's what each component node does:

1. **GenerateTechnicalInfo:** This node generates technical information required for the rest of the workflow.
2. **CreateFilesStructure:** This node creates the necessary file structure for the project based on the technical information generated by the previous node.
3. **CreateSource:** This node creates the source code for the project based on the technical information generated by the first node.
4. **CreateInfra:** This node creates the necessary infrastructure required for the source code to run, based on the technical information generated by the first node.
5. **CreateTests:** This node creates the tests for the source code.
6. **CreateDocs:** This node creates the documentation for the source code.
7. **RunTests:** This node runs the tests created by the previous node and checks if there are any errors.
8. **FixSource:** This node fixes any issues found in the source code by the previous node.

### **Loop**

The CFC also includes a loop, which can be applied to the workflow. Here are the details of the loop:

1. **Type:** The loop type is "while".
2. **Condition:** The loop condition is defined in the "cond" parameter, which is set to "len(results["node-7"]["errors"]) == 0". This means that the loop will continue to run as long as there are no errors in the test results from node-7.
3. **Max Runs:** The loop will run a maximum of 5 times, as defined in the "max_runs" parameter.
4. **Step:** The loop will run in steps of 1.

### **Flow Matrix**

The "flow-matrix" section represents the flow of the CFC using a matrix. Each row and column in the matrix represents a component node, and the cells in the matrix indicate the connections between the nodes. A value of 1 in a cell indicates that there is a connection between the corresponding row and column nodes. Here's what the flow matrix looks like:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, "loop-1{1", 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, "1"],
[0, 0, 0, 0, "1}", 0, 0, 0, 0]]

```

Here's what each row and column represents:

- Row/Column 1: GenerateTechnicalInfo
- Row/Column 2: CreateFilesStructure
- Row/Column 3: CreateSource
- Row/Column 4: CreateInfra
- Row/Column 5: CreateTests
- Row/Column 6: CreateDocs
- Row/Column 7: RunTests
- Row/Column 8: FixSource

Here's what the connections between the nodes mean:

- Row 1 to Column 2: GenerateTechnicalInfo is connected to CreateFilesStructure.
- Row 1 to Column 3: GenerateTechnicalInfo is connected to CreateSource.
- Row 2 to Column 3: CreateFilesStructure is connected to CreateSource.
- Row 3 to Columns 4, 5, and 6: CreateSource is connected to CreateInfra, CreateTests, and CreateDocs.
- Row 5 to Column 7: CreateTests is connected to RunTests.
- Row 7 to Columns 8 and 5: RunTests is connected to FixSource and CreateTests. If there are no errors in the test results, the flow continues to FixSource. If there are errors, the flow loops back to CreateTests.
- Row 4 and 6: CreateInfra and CreateDocs do not have any outgoing connections.
- Loop 1: The loop is represented by the cell at row 5, column 7, which contains "loop-1{1". This means that the flow loops back to the beginning of CreateTests if the loop condition is met, as defined in the "loops" section.

### **Flow ASCII Representation**

The "flow-ascii-rep" section provides an ASCII representation of the flow using arrows and lines. Here's what the flow looks like:

```
1 +--> 2 -+
  |       |
  |       v
  +-----> 3                              + --> 4
          |                              |
          +--> loop-1{ 5 --> 7 --> 8 } --+ --> 6
                       ^           |
                       |           |
                       + --------- +


```

Overall, this CFC workflow generates technical information, creates a file structure, creates the source code and infrastructure required to run it, creates tests and documentation, runs the tests, and fixes any issues in the source code. The loop can be applied to the test creation and execution process to ensure that the tests are error-free before moving on to the next step.
