## AbstractComponent

`AbstractComponent` is a Python class that provides a consistent interface for building components that can be integrated into a larger application. It is designed to ensure that components meet the necessary requirements and standards.

### Requirements

To use `AbstractComponent`, a component must implement the `__init__` and `transform` methods, which are abstract methods defined by the `abc` module. The `__init__` method initializes the component, and the `transform` method performs the main functionality of the component.

### Class Methods

The `AbstractComponent` class provides several class methods that are used to check the structure and requirements of a component:

- `check_init_is_typed()`: This method checks that the `__init__` method of the component is properly typed.
- `check_init_parameters_reserved_words()`: This method checks that the parameters of the `__init__` method do not include reserved words.
- `check_component_card()`: This method checks that the component has a file called `component_card.md` in its directory.
- `check_component_configuration()`: This method checks that the component has a file called `configuration.yml` in its directory.
- `check_component_dockerfile()`: This method checks that the component has a file called `Dockerfile` in its directory.
- `check_component_requirements()`: This method checks that the component has a file called `requirements.txt` in its directory.
- `check_is_module()`: This method checks that the component is structured as a module.
- `check_has_unit_tests()`: This method checks that the component has a file called `t_component.py` in its directory.

These methods are all called by the `test_cls()` method, which is a class method that can be called on any subclass of `AbstractComponent`. This method checks that the component meets all the necessary requirements and standards.

### File Paths

The `AbstractComponent` class also provides several class methods that return file paths for various files required by a component, such as `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `configuration.yml`, and `component_card.md`.

### Extending `AbstractComponent`

To use `AbstractComponent`, a component should extend the class by inheriting from it:

```python
class MyComponent(AbstractComponent):
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
    def transform(self, args):
        # ...
```
The component should implement the `__init__` and `transform` methods, and may also implement the fit method if necessary.

Once the component has been implemented, it can be tested using the `test_cls()` method:

```python
MyComponent.test_cls()
```
This method will raise an appropriate exception if the component does not meet the necessary requirements and standards.

### Conclusion
`AbstractComponent` is a useful tool for building components that can be integrated into a larger application. By providing a consistent interface and a set of standards and requirements, it helps ensure that components are well-structured, maintainable, and easy to use.
