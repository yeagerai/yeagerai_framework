# Yeager SDK

Yeager is an SDK for exponential development, powered by generative AI. Our SDK allows developers to build apps faster and more efficiently by automatically creating and optimizing workflows and projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Yeager SDK, follow these steps:

1. Install the Yeager SDK on your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install yeager-sdk
    ```

2. Start the Yeager server by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python start_server.py
    ```
   This will start the @yeager engine and open a socket for the client to connect to.

3. Start the Yeager command-line interface (CLI) by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python yeager_cli.py
    ```
   This will connect the CLI to the server and allow you to interact with @yeager in natural language.

4. Start building your app using Yeager-CLI! You can give natural language commands to @yeager through the CLI, and @yeager will build the workflows and projects for you.

## Features

The Yeager SDK comes with a range of features designed to help you achieve exponential development, including:

- **Speak your mind**: With Yeager, developers can describe their app idea in natural language, making it easy to get started on a project in seconds.

- **Hands-free coding**: Yeager generates the code, workflows, and documentation for you automatically, so you can focus on perfecting your app's user experience.

- **Total control**: Yeager's interactive modification cycle lets you fine-tune the generated code and workflows to meet your needs, ensuring that your app is optimized for success.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how you could use the Yeager SDK in your own app development projects:

### Example 1: 

```
Create a workflow that when I receive a new lead on hubspot send a greeting email via Mailchimp with a banner created by midjourney
```

### Example 2: 
```
Create a workflow that receives a python repository and modifies the code to pass the pylint, mypy, and pytest tests
```
